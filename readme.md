## Languages

*Languages running on the JVM.*

* [Ceylon](http://ceylon-lang.org/) - Object-oriented, strong and static programming language with an emphasis on immutability, created by Red Hat.
* [Clojure](http://clojure.org/) - Dialect of Lisp created by Rich Hickey. Dynamically typed with emphasis on functional programming.
* [Erjang](http://www.erjang.org) - A JVM-based Erlang VM.
* [Frege](https://github.com/Frege/frege) - Pure functional programming language in the spirit of Haskell.
* [Groovy](http://www.groovy-lang.org/) - Optionally typed and dynamic language, with static-typing and static compilation capabilities.
* [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html) - General-purpose, concurrent, strongly typed, class-based object-oriented language.
* [JRuby](http://jruby.org) - Implementation of the Ruby language on the JVM.
* [Jython](http://www.jython.org) - Python for the Java Platform.
* [Kawa](http://www.gnu.org/software/kawa/) - Extension of the Scheme language, which is in the Lisp family of programming languages.
* [Kotlin](http://kotlinlang.org/) - Statically typed programming language for the JVM, Android and the browser.
* [Nashorn](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/nashorn/) - Lightweight high-performance JavaScript runtime in Java with a native JVM.
* [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) - Strong and static programming language that combine object-oriented and functional programming ideas.

## Profilers

*Tools that provide profiling information to aid program optimization*
* [BTrace](https://github.com/jbachorik/btrace) - a safe, dynamic tracing tool for the Java platform.
* [Chronon](http://chrononsystems.com) - Record your entire java program. Replay on any machine.
* [GCViewer](https://github.com/chewiebug/GCViewer) - GCViewer is a tool that visualizes verbose GC output.
* [Java Mission Control](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaseproducts/mission-control/java-mission-control-1998576.html) - Continuously collect low level and detailed runtime information enabling after-the-fact incident analysis.
* [jHiccup](http://www.azulsystems.com/jHiccup) - jHiccup is an open source tool designed to measure the pauses and stalls associated with an application’s underlying Java runtime platform.
* [JProfiler](https://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html) - Helps resolve performance bottlenecks, pin down memory leaks and understand threading issues.
* [Riemann JVM Profiler](https://github.com/riemann/riemann-jvm-profiler) - JVM agent which sends function-level profiler telemetry to a Riemann server for analysis, visualization, and storage.
* [Swiss Java Knife](https://github.com/aragozin/jvm-tools) - Small set of tools for JVM troublshooting, monitoring and profiling.
* [Takipi](https://www.takipi.com/) - Tells you when and why code breaks in production.
* [YourKit](https://www.yourkit.com/) - Fully featured, easy to use, low overhead profiler for Java EE and Java SE platforms.

## Virtual Machines

*Virtual machines that implement the JVM specification.*
* [HotSpot](http://openjdk.java.net/groups/hotspot/) - HotSpot virtual machine maintained and distributed by Oracle Corporation.
* [IBM J9](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/) - JVM developed by IBM.
* [Zing](http://www.azulsystems.com/products/zing) - The only JVM that eliminates Java garbage collection pauses for large heap sizes.
* [Zulu](http://www.azulsystems.com/products/zulu) - The only certified multi-platform build of OpenJDK: Free, 100% open source Java.
